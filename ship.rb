Reflecting on Principle
-----------------------
1. What does the OOD promise to give us, as programmers?
2. What does Martin's SOLID acronym stand for? (Just expand the acronym.)
3. True or False: It is our professional responsibility to always spend time designing before writing our code (designing now rather than later).
4. In Metz' TRUE acronym, what does the E stand for and what does it mean?
5. How does applying SRP naturally lead to good design?
